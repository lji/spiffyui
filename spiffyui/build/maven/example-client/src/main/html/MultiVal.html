    The multi-valued suggest box is an autocompleter that allows for multiple values and browsing. It uses REST to retrieve suggestions from the server.  The full process is documented in  <a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/gwt-rest-auto">Creating a Multi-Valued Auto-Complete Field Using GWT SuggestBox and REST</a>.
    You can extend it to have suggestions display any information you want, as we have done here.
