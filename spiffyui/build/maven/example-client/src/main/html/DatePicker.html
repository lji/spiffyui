    Spiffy UI's date picker shows a calendar for easy date selection.  It wraps the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker"> JQuery UI Date Picker</a> which is better tested, has more features, and is easier to style than the GWT date picker control.  The JQuery Date Picker includes many features including the ablility to specify the minimum  and maximum dates and changing the way to pick months and years.

    The Spiffy UI Framework is localized into 53 languages.  Try changing your browser locale and refreshing  this page. In addition, since it is a GWT widget, you may get the selected date value as a java.util.Date.
