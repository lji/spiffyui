The SPSample checkout includes a copy of Apache Ant included.  Execute the following
command:

        ant all run
        
This will download the required libraries, build the Spiffy UI framework, and run
it with an embedded web server.  It will then provide intructions for accessing
the running application.

Spiffy UI uses Apache ant with Apache Ivy to build.  If you have Apache Ant installed
without Apache Ivy you might see the following error:

    Problem: failed to create task or type antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant:settings
    
The solution is to make sure you are running the correct version of Ant by using
the full path to Ant like this:

        ant all run
