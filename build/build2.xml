<project name="Spiffy UI Resolver" xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant" default="resolve" basedir="..">
    <!--
        Spiffy UI basically has two lib directories.  The default lib 
        directory and a special one called build/lib.  The first one
        contains JARs which must be included in the WAR file and the
        second one contains JARs that are only needed for building.
        I haven't figured out a way to make Apache Ivy recognize
        different lib directories for different artifacts, so we have
        to load the files in this subproject.
        
        This is pretty hacky.  I wish I had a better way to do this.
