    Spiffy UI is a set of reusable utilities that integrates well with GWT widgets, <a href="http://gwt-ext.com/">GWT EXT</a>, and any other GWT widget framework you would like to use.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Along with that integration Spiffy UI provides a handful of widgets that we've found useful for layout, message handling, JQuery integration, and more.
