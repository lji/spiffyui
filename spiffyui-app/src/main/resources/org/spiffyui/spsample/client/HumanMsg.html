<p>
    The Spiffy UI framework has an integrated message framework following the pattern of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/humanmsg/">Humanized Messages</a>.   These messages are non-modal and fade away without requiring further interaction.  They include info messages, warnings, errors, and fatal errors.  Errors and some warnings are sent to an error log at the bottom of the screen.
