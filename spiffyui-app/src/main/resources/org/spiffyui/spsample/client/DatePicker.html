    Spiffy UI's date picker shows a calendar for easy date selection.  It wraps the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker"> JQuery UI Date Picker</a> which is better tested, has more features, and is easier to style than the GWT date picker control.  The JQuery Date Picker includes many features including the ability to specify minimum and maximum dates, and to change the way months and years are selected.

    The Spiffy UI Framework is localized into 53 languages.  Try changing your browser locale and refreshing this page. In addition, since it is a GWT widget, you may get the selected date value as a java.util.Date.
