    <h2>Contribute</h2>
    
    <p>
    Can you sling code like a pro?  Why not help us out with Spiffy UI.  We're always happy to take patches, bug fixes, and new features.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Once you've checked out the code and made sure your change builds you can generate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)">patch</a>.  We always love patches, but we're kind of picky about our code.  For a patch to get accepted it must: 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Build and run</b>.  This sounds obvious, but we need all code to build and run on all of our supported browsers listed on the <span id="supportMatrixLink"></span> before we can take it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Well formatted</b>.  All Java code must pass 100% percent of all Checkstyle checks and all JavaScript code must pass JSLint with no warnings.  Both of these are included in the build.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Be generic</b>.  Projects like this get bloated really fast if we're not careful.  Everything we take into the project must be generically usable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Be bounded</b>.  Spiffy UI is dedicated to modularity.  Every piece of code must have clear boundaries.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Be internationalized</b>.  All strings must be in resource bundles, all dates and currencies must be localizable, and all encodings should be UTF-8.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Be independent</b>.  Spiffy UI runs against REST endpoints written on any server so your contribution can't rely on any Java on the server.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Well documented</b>. Every class and interface in Spiffy UI must have well written and complete <a href="javadoc/index.html">JavaDoc</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Fast</b>. Spiffy UI wants to make every page load in under 1.5 seconds.  That means each component must be fast.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Unit tested</b>. All new code should include <a href="index-test.html">unit tests</a> where appropriate.
    </p>

    </p>
    
    <h3>ReviewBoard</h3>
    
    <p>
        ReviewBoard is a convenient way to contribute patches, using a code review web application that improves the conversation about the contribution.

    </p>
