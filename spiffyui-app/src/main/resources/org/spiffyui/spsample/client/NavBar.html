    The main navigation bar makes it easy to add styled navigation menus to your application with highlights, collapsible sections, and separators.  These items navigate between different panels in your application, but can also navigate between different HTML pages.
</p> 

<p> 
    The navigation menu also supports the back button when navigating between JavaScript panels in the same page.  This makes it possible to support the back button, forward button, and browser history while maintaining the JavaScript state of your application and keeping very fast page loading. 
</p> 

<p> 
    The menus use CSS layout for flexibility.  See the examples on the <span id="cssPageWidgetsLink"></span>.
