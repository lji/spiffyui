    <h2>Build the full Spiffy UI Application</h2>
    
    <p>
        When you're ready to take the next steps you can build this entire website and get an inside look at the more advanced Spiffy UI application.  Check it out and build it in about a minute.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    1. Use the following command to check out the Spiffy UI application which also includes the Spiffy UI framework:
    </p>
    <pre>
    svn co http://spiffyui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk spiffyui
    </pre>
        
    <p>
    2. Add the <code>external/ant/bin</code> directory to your path.  <span class="weak">You can also use your own version of Ant 1.8 with Apache Ivy.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    3. Execute this command line from the <code>spiffyui</code> directory:   
    </p>
    
    <pre>
    ant all run
    </pre>
        
    <p>
    This will build the project and launch it with an embedded <a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> server.  You can also deploy the spsample.war file to your favorite J2EE server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Note</b>:  The first time you build the project it must download project dependencies.  After that the build process should take about one minute to complete.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why's it called Spiffy</h2>

    <p>
    The Spiffy UI framework started as part of the <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/identitymanager/">Novell Identity Manager</a> Reporting Module.    The Reporting Module spent a long time without an official name so we started calling it Our Spiffy Reporting Tool.  The name just stuck.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Thank you for taking a look at the framework.  We hope it helps your project.
