    <h2 id="HE_Full" title="Comprehensive examples">Build the full Spiffy UI Application</h2>
    
    <p>
        This site is written with Spiffy UI and all of the code is open source.  
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
        Use the following command to check out the Spiffy UI application, which also includes the Spiffy UI framework:
        <br><br>
        <pre>
        svn co http://spiffyui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk spiffyui
        </pre>
        </li>
    
        <li>
        Download <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> and add it to your path.
        </li>
    
        <li>
        3. Execute this command line from the <code>spiffyui</code> directory:   
        <br><br>
        
        <pre>
        ant all run
        </pre>
        </li>
            
    </ol>
    <p>
    This will build the project, generate the <code>spsample.war</code>, and launch it with an embedded <a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> server.  You can also deploy the <code>spsample.war</code> file to your favorite J2EE server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Note</b>:  The first time you build the project it must download project dependencies.  After that the build process should take about one minute to complete.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="HE_Name">Why it's called Spiffy</h2>

    <p>
    The Spiffy UI framework started as part of the <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/identitymanager/">Novell Identity Manager</a> Reporting Module.    The Reporting Module spent a long time without an official name so we started calling it Our Spiffy Reporting Tool.  The name just stuck.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Thank you for taking a look at the framework.  We hope it helps your project.
    </p>
