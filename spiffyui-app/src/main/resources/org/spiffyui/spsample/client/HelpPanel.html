    <h2 id="HE_JavaDoc">JavaDoc</h2>
    
    <p>
    Most of the Spiffy UI framework is Java code written in GWT.  See the <a href="javadoc/index.html">Spiffy UI API JavaDoc</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="HE_Name">Why it's called Spiffy</h2>

    <p>
    The Spiffy UI framework started as part of the <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/identitymanager/">Novell Identity Manager</a> Reporting Module.    The Reporting Module spent a long time without an official name so we started calling it Our Spiffy Reporting Tool.  The name just stuck.

    Thank you for taking a look at the framework.  We hope it helps your project.
