<!-- This is the template file for the main application page.  The first 
     step here is to add some elements with special IDs we'll bind to later.
     Each on of these elements will get a dynamic control added to it in
     src/main/java/MY_PACKAGE/client/Index.java.

        This is a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org">Spiffy UI</a> application built just for you and running on your computer.  This simple example shows you an easy form which makes a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/#b=rest">REST</a> call to your server. You can edit it, build it, run it, share it with your friends, and build a product on top of it.  The application is all yours.
