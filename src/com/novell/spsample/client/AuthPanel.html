<h1>Spiffy UI Authentication</h1>

    <p>
        All REST calls are anonymous by default.  The Spiffy UI framework offers login based on a scheme we've developed here at Novell called tokenized identity.  This token-base security model support simple authentication, single sign-on, and stateless security models. 
    </p>

        <h3>Try it out</h3>
        
        <p>
        Most of this sample is available without authentication, but we've added a security example you can try.

    <h2>Security customization</h2>
    
    <p>
    Tokenized identity works for us, but it doesn't have to work for you.  When you use the Spiffy UI framework you can specify your own authentication handling.  You can customize our login dialog or write your own.  You can also skip security altogether and make your application anonymous.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Tokenized identity</h2>
    
    <p>
    The broad strokes of the authentication process are very simple.  You request some data, the server tells you it requires authentication, you get a token, and you give the token back to the server to get your data.  Just like getting a key to open a door, your token gives you access to the data.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Managing the token this way has many advantages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>You don't have to trust the REST server</b>.  No more giving your username and password to random web applications.  You just trust the token and never give your password to anyone else.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Single sign-on</b>.  Since the tokens are generic you can reuse them for multiple servers and only log in once.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Tokens time out</b>.  Unlike your house key the token comes with a built-in expiration date.  If a bad guys gets your token it doesn't last.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Tokens can be stateless</b>.  REST has no session, your tokens shouldn't either.  Combine your tokens with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML">SAML</a> and you'll get stateless authentication.  This scales to the cloud and keeps you logged in even if your server goes down.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Authentication proxy</h2>
    <p>
        All REST calls are governed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a> and may only call back to the server that served the JavaScript.  This is fine for most REST data calls, but single sign-on requires you to call to another server.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The Spiffy UI framework supplies a REST authentication proxy service that makes it possible to authenticate against any server.  This proxy is implemented in AuthServlet.java.  The process works like this:
    </p>

    <p>1. Client makes a request to server url http://host:post/data-server-war-context/path-require-auth in order to access some resources.</p>

    <p>2. Server looks for specific authentication header, since it is not found, it returns back JSON indicating no authentication information available.
        It will also send back WWW-Authenticate response header, with authentication server url information, letting client know to authenticate.</p>
        <p>
    <pre>WWW-Authenticate  X-OPAQUE uri="http://host2:port2/auth-server-war-context/auth-path", signOffUri=""</pre>
    <p>

    <p>3. Due to same origin policy, client can not directly contact the authentication server which is on a different server.
        So client contacts a servlet (AuthServlet) that is in the same client war, forwarding on user credentials.
        The servlet, which acts as a proxy, then contacts the authentication server at http://host2:port2/auth-server-war-context/auth-path to ask for
        authentication token to access data server resources. To use the proxy servlet, it must be added to the web.xml of the client war.</p>
      <p>
      <pre>
      &lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;AuthServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.novell.spiffyui.server.AuthServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
      &lt;/servlet&gt;

      &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;AuthServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/auth/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
      &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
      </pre>

    <p>4. If user's credentials is sufficient, authentication server will return back an authentication token in JSON format, such as:</p>
    <p>
    <pre>{"Token":"demo_user"} </pre>
    <p>
    <p> to the proxy servlet, which then forwards the token back to client to be saved in browser cookie.</p>

    <p>5. Client can now make the request to access the resources again on the data server at original url:  http://host:post/data-server-war-context/path-require-auth,
        carrying authentication token in request header "Authorization":
    <p>
    <pre> Authorization	X-OPAQUE demouser </pre>
    <p>

    <p>6. Data server checks and validates the authentication token, then returns back requested resources.</p>

    <h2>Detailed authentication example</h2>
    
    <p>The authentication proxy is just a helper in this process.  The real work happens in the token exchange.  You can skip the proxy if you're calling from Java or any other language that doesn't use the same origin policy.  Here's what happens when you click the login button above.</p>
    
    <p>
        <img id="loginImage" src="images/login.png" />
    </p>

    <p>1. Browser sends "GET" request to http://localhost:8081/spsample/authdata (implemented by SampleDataServlet).</p>

    <p>2. Server returns 401 (Unauthorized) with the NoAuthHeader fault payload, and WWW-Authenticate response header
X-OPAQUE uri="http://localhost:8081/spsample/authserver", signOffUri=""</p>

    <p>3. Browser shows Login Panel, prompting user for credentials user name and password and sends those credentials to the authentication proxy at http://localhost:8081/spsample/auth. </p>

    <p>4. Proxy server <code>AuthServlet</code> contacts authentication server (implemented by SampleAuthServer)
        at http://localhost:8081/spsample/authserver to ask for authentication token.</p>
        
    <p class="optionalText">5. The authentication optionally rejects the authentication type.</p>
    
    <p class="optionalText">6. The proxy resends the authentication in the proper format.</p>
        
    <p>7. The authentication server generates a token and returns it to the client.  In order to make our sample easier the token is always your username.</p>

    <p>8. The proxy server returns the token to the browser.  </p>

    <p>9. The browser uses the token to request the data.</p>
    
    <p class="optionalText">10. The REST server can now call back to the authentication server to verify the token.  If the token is SAML the REST server may be able to verify it without calling to a separate server.</p>
    
    <p class="optionalText">11. The authentication server responds back that the token is valid.</p>

    <p>12. The REST server sends back the secure data.</p>
    
    <p>
        Now that the token exchange has been established the browser can request data from the REST server without using the AuthServlet or the authentication server.
