    <p>
    We're working on making the Spiffy UI framework open source, but for now it is available only to Novell projects.  You can use the Spiffy UI framework for your project.  We support new projects and all of the open source code included in this project has been reviewed by the Novell open source review board.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Try out the sample application</h2>
    
    <p>
    Downloading and trying out this entire website, built on the Spiffy UI framework, is a fast and easy way to get plenty of sample code and documentation.  
    You can check it out anonymously and build it in about a minute.  It deploys to any J2EE application server you want.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    1. Use the following command to check out the Spiffy Sample application which also includes the Spiffy UI framework:
    </p>
    <pre>
    svn co https://svn.provo.novell.com/svn/spiffyui/sample spsample
    </pre>
        
    <p>
    2. Set the environment variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to the location of your JDK (1.6 or higher).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    3. Place the <code>external/ant/bin</code> directory in your path <span class="weak">(optional)</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    4. Execute this command line from the <code>spsample</code> directory:   
    </p>
    <pre>
    ant <span class="weak">(if not on your path then: <code>external/ant/bin/ant</code>)</span>
    </pre>
        
    <p>
    5. Once the build completes you can deploy the spsample.war file from <code>dist/spsample.war</code>.

    <h2>Using spiffy</h2>

    <p>
    Most of the Spiffy UI framework is Java code written in GWT.  All of the API has Java doc in the <a href="javadoc/index.html">Spiffy UI API JavaDoc</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Thank you for taking a look at the framework.  We hope it helps your project.
